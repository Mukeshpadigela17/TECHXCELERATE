# TECHXCELERATE

üîå Home Automation using Arduino (IoT Project)
This project is a smart home automation system built using Arduino and IoT sensors to monitor and control room conditions.

üåü Key Features:

Temperature Monitoring: Uses sensors like DHT11/DHT22 to check room temperature and humidity.

Light Detection: LDR sensor detects ambient light to automate lights based on brightness levels.

Automatic Control: Fans or lights can be turned ON/OFF based on sensor data (e.g., hot room ‚Üí fan ON).

Remote Access: Controlled via mobile app or web interface (using Wi-Fi module like ESP8266/NodeMCU).

Energy Efficient: Helps reduce power consumption by automating appliances.
